• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
  gitignore tells file which files it should ignore. It is usually used to avoid commiting files from your directory which   are not useful such as ompilation files IDE creates.
 For Java project it includes files such as:
  # Compiled class file
  *.class
  # Log file
  *.log
  # BlueJ files
  *.ctxt
  # Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
  .mtj.tmp/
  # Package Files #
  *.jar
  *.war
  *.nar
  *.ear
  *.zip
  *.tar.gz
  *.rar
  # virtual machine crash logs, see http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xmlhs_err_pid*

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
  In Git, when we update the head pointer in such a way that its new value is direct descendant of the prior value. In   other words when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history,     Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together – this is called   a “fast-forward.”

• Why should you have different branches?
  Different branches allow different people to work independently on individual branches and after the work is done they   can merge it to main branch.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
  In a project we can have multiple Git repositories.Having multiple repositories makes it easy to give access to subsets   of repositories to outsiders who should not get access to whole project.
